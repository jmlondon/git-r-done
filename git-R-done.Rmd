git-R-done | Using R, git and github to further reproducible science
====================================================================

## Today, you are NOT going to learn ... 

- R
- git
- github

## Today, you ARE going to learn ...

- About reproducible research in R
- How you might incorporate git into your scientific workflow
- How github enhances the transparency and openess of your science

## Learn to Tell a Story ... From the Beginning

1. Research Planning/Desing
2. Data Collection
3. Data Management and Munging
4. Data Analysis
5. Pretty Graphs/Pictures
6. **Presentations and Publications**

Version Control
========================================================

## Many of you already use a version control system without realizing it

- file/folder naming conventions
    * _myanalysis.R
    * _myanalysis-1.R
    * _myanalysis-20141103.R
    * _myanalysis-20141103-JML.R

- Google drive apps (docs, spreadsheet, presentations)

- MS Word Track Changes (ugh)


## Git Allows You to Tell a Story While Exploring

- branches = parallel dimensions
    * typical approach is to have a *develop* and *master* branch
    * other options include feature branches, bug-fix branches
    * no cost to creating a branch, easily 'pruned'

- commits = punchlines
    * commit often
    * brief and descriptive

## Writing and Structuring a Commit Message

**GOOD EXAMPLE**

CREATED THE convertDD() FUNCTION

latitude and longitude data were provided in DMS,
so created this function to convert values to decimal degrees

**BAD EXAMPLE**

DID SOME MISC STUFF TO THE CODE

i forgot to commit for the last two weeks, not sure what I
did so just typing blah blah blah

## Resources for Learning Git

- Getting Git Right

    https://www.atlassian.com/git/
    
- Learn Version Control with Git

- Getting Started - Git Basics

## Using Git with R and Science

Scientific analysis and R doesn't follow a typical software development cycle ... so don't force it to

- start with a single user and a single branch
- commit often and tell a story
- tags to mark milestones

- learn git by using it with a meaningful project

## Using Git with R and Science

As you get comfortable, branch out

- create a _develop_ branch
- _master_ branch always works
- simple branches off _develop_

Using Git with RStudio
=======================================================

Collaborating with Git
======================================================

## Git Servers

There are two options available

* gitlab.afsc.noaa.gov
* github.com

AFSC GitLab

* Web:   https://gitlab.afsc.noaa.gov  / https://161.55.120.151
* Git+ssh:   ssh://git@gitlab.afsc.noaa.gov:2222/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;project&gt;.git

## AFSC GitLab

* LDAP user accounts and authentication (NOAA only)
* Unlimited private or internal repositories
* Public repositories are also an option
* Available from the internet (VPN not required)

## Communicate with Collaborators

* develop a collaboration plan early on
* git is not a replacement for talking
* git in the habit of pushing/pulling
* don't be afraid to merge

## Pushing and Pulling

## Git Doesn't Replace Communication

## GitHub

## GitHub and the Federal Government

## Github at NOAA/NMFS ... or not?

## Fundamental Research Communication

## Scientific Integrity Policy

## Value GitHub as a Component in the Scientific Process

## Be Professional, Be Smart, Be Secure

## GitHub and the Publication Process

- GitHub is for hosting code and analysis
- Not a data archive (e.g. NODC, NGDC, Dryan, Figshare)
- Mozilla Science Lab/Figshare/GitHub for Minting DOI's

## You Will Not Learn Git Overnight

## Jump In with Both Feet

## Make Mistakes
